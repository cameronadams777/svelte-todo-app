# Components

This is where all of our apps components will live. 

## Naming convention

Things that are more generic that are not app specific but rather are wrappers of existing HTML elements, should be defined as `app-*.svelte` where as customer components like `todo-list-item.svelte` can have a name that is more closely related to it's use.
